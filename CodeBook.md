# Getting and Cleaning Data
## Goal
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Source Data 
Data + Description can be found at UCI Machine Learning

## Attribute Information
For each record in the dataset it is provided:
1. Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
2. Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
3. A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
4. Its activity label.
5. An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
